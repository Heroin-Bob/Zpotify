Zpotify is a tool designed to pull the track list data from a given public Spotify playlist and convert it to a Zune compatible playlist format. It then scans your media folder to look for those tracks based on the names of the directories and files contained. 

There is no installation needed to run Zpotify! Simply run Zpotify.exe and you'll be prompted with next steps.
